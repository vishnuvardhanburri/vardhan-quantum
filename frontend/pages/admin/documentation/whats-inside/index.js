        <h1>Overview</h1>
        <p className="lead">
            This large app consists of two parts. Front-end and back-end respectively.<br />
          Let's start with the UI part. We have carefully designed and coded pages.<br />
          With help of NextJS, we are now able to send server-side rendered code to the end-user and thus have <strong>SEO-friendly</strong> website.<br />
          There is an SEO module in this project, <strong>SEO</strong> content can be added and edited by the content manager.<br />
          A lot of stuff going on in the admin panel:
            <br /><br />
          1) Tables with real backend data, you can preview content without opening the view page. Also, you can filter by date.<br />
          2) View page where you can see all the fields with or without values for a certain entity e.g. product.<br />
          3) Edit page is mostly the same as View, but there you can save changes.<br />
          <br /><br />
          <h2>So let's go over the admin side</h2>

          Nice and clean Home page with charts, statistics, and tabs widget.<br />
          Orders tab is a list of orders that you can filter, view, and edit<br />
          Feedback is a great thing for online business and we added full-featured feedback to this project, you can view and moderate feedback, wow!<br /><br />
          The blog is a small <strong>ready-made CMS</strong>, you can create blog posts with a bunch of dynamic data and multiple images just give it a try!<br /><br />
         
          <img className="img-responsive w-100 border mt-4 mb-4" src={blogScreenshot} alt="screenshot" />
          <br />
          <strong>Products</strong> are heart of every e-commerce project you can set price, image, category for filtering, discount, and much more<br /><br />
          Users is a place where all you customers are at a glance.<br />
          <br />
          <img className="img-responsive w-100 border mt-4 mb-4" src={usersScreenshot} alt="screenshot" />
          <br />
          Categories are mostly used for filtering so-called helper for you business.<br />
          My profile serves admin and customer to view their data and change it if needed.<br />
          Change password speaks for itself.<br />
          <img className="img-responsive w-100 border mt-4 mb-4" src={passwordScreenshot} alt="screenshot" />
          Documentation is designed to help you learn all about this template.
          <br />
          Client-side is accessible for everyone and you can explore it just by clicking here and there, all the pages are mobile and <strong>SEO friendly</strong><br /><br />
          Check out the billing page, it has stripe integration so you can test it out and also easily change stripe credentials so payment setup is going to be effortless.<br /><br />
          There is a wishlist where you can see desired products and purchase at some point in time. And much more, explore the template and make a purchase.

        <h2>Let's talk about what's going on under the hood and I mean backend.</h2>
        <br />
        It's built with help of the express js framework. We use Postgres as a database and squelize serves as ORM.
        There were two reasons why we picked this stack. First of all, community, clear documentation, and a lot of open-source libraries.
        Second of all, we are experts with this technology.
        <br /><br />
        So what is inside?<br /><br />
        The first thing I want to mention is the passport.js library for authentication. Simple, unobtrusive authentication that became standard in the <strong>NodeJS</strong> world. For password encryption we used bcrypt.
        In db > api folder we have all the necessary files with <strong>CRUD</strong> methods to interact with DB.<br /><br />
        Models are just data objects that clearly showcase what kind of data we can anticipate for each entity.<br /><br />
        Seeders are a heap of sample data that is added to the web app by default with help of yarn reset.<br /><br />
        In <code>db.config</code> you can configure your database credentials for development and production.<br /><br />
        Routes have files with all available routes and you can see that particular routes have passport middleware and some do not, this is a great feature if you need certain routes to be reachable by authorized users and unauthorized.<br /><br />
        Services are made following an abstraction pattern. Basically, service imports methods from the api and gives you a nice and clean way to harness <strong>CRUD</strong> functionality and have readable and clean code, enjoy!<br /><br />
        Config has all the configurations, just update the values and your config is ready, as simple as that.<br /><br />
        All magic happens at the Index file, this is where your node js app starts!<br /><br />
        
        I believe you will find a lot of new interesting code and development practices exploring source code. The file uploading module is really powerful and important for every app.
        After you got a gist of this code it will be extremely easy for you to add new routes and enhance functionality. The code is readable and even if you don't have a great experience with node and expressjs you will be able to make full use of it.<br />
        Good Luck!
